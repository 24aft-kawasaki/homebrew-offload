# Brew-offload

**Brew-offload** is a wrapper around [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) that helps you manage disk space efficiently by offloading large formulae to other directories or external storage.

## Overview

As your Homebrew installation grows, it can quickly consume significant disk space—especially with large packages and dependencies. **Brew-offload** addresses this issue by automatically relocating selected formulae to configurable or external storage, keeping your main drive clean without disrupting your normal Homebrew workflow.
